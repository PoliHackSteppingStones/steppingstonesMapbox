# steppingstonesMapbox
- I have done a pull of this to better understand Mapbox
- I am noticing that the filtering part of the application is not there
- I love how when I preview yow-GJ.json in GitHub the full application comes up, how is that possible! :D
- I am noticing a difference between what I load on my localhost compared to what I load on in GitHub
